Having struggled with understanding how Next js and Tailwind css work, I made the clone to understand how to use them. Available on [Vercel ](http://airbnb-redisign-2.vercel.app/)and [Github](https://github.com/levos-snr/airbnb-redisign).
I was able to accomplish this with the help of Sonny Sangha a fellow developer through a five day Next challange competition in the youtube.
